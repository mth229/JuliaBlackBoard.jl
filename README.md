Write BlackBoard questions for question pools or tests within Julia.

The basic workflow is a Julia script is used to generate questions in a tab-separated-values file to
upload into BlackBoard. Both tests and pools (for randomizing test questions) provide "upload questions" for this format.

* Supports the question types of [BlackBoard](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Tests_Pools_Surveys/Reuse_Questions/Upload_Questions) (except `QUIZ_BOWL`)

* Can use markdown or LaTeX to author the questions. Markdown with
  LaTeX markup can be rendered (somewhat) as HTML by
  [tth](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tth). Questions specified in
  LaTeX can also be presented as png files created from the pdf output of
  running LaTeX (first page only). Mixing and matching allows one to
  show latex formulas as images and markup in HTML (voila, back to the
  y2k-era math-on-the-web display).

* Random pools can be created through the use of Mustache templates to
  author questions to faciliate the randomization.

For example, a basic pool of randomized questions can be generated by running this as a script. (This particular example might be better using the Formula Question type directly, as the increased flexibility of computing the answer is not exploited)

```
using JuliaBlackBoard

dirnm = dirname(@__FILE__)
basenm = replace(basename(@__FILE__), r".jl$" => "") # grab names

open(joinpath(dirnm, "$basenm.txt"), "w") do io

  q = mt"""
# Times tables

What is ${{:a}} * {{:b}}$?
"""

  for a in 2:3, b in 2:3
    question(io, NUM, q(a=a,b=b), a*b)
  end
  
end
```	

If saved in `/tmp/test.jl`, say, and included into `Julia` with `include("/tmp/test.jl")`, a file `/tmp/test.txt` will be generated for upload into BlackBoard. 

In the above, `q` is a Mustache template holding Markdown-formatted text with its values `:a` and `:b` populated by the call `q(a=a, b=b)` in the loop. LaTeX markup is used to format the product for illustration. In this example, `tth` converts it into HTML for upload.

A kitchen-sink-type example is the  [examples](examples/test-examples.jl) directory.
