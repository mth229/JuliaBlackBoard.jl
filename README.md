Write BlackBoard questions for question pools or tests within Julia.

A simple numeric answer question

The basic workflow is a Julia script is used to generate questions in a tab-separated-values file to
upload into BlackBoard.

* Supports the question types of [BlackBoard](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Tests_Pools_Surveys/Reuse_Questions/Upload_Questions)

* Can use markdown or LaTeX to author the questions. Markdown with
  LaTeX markup can be rendered (somewwhat) as HTML by
  [tth](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tth). Questions specified in
  LaTeX can be presented as png files created from the pdf output of
  running LaTeX (first page only). Mixing and matching allows one to
  show latex formulas as images and markup in HTML (voila, back to the
  y2k-era math-on-the-web display).

* Random pools can be created through the use of Mustache templates to
  author questions to faciliate the randomization.

For example, a basic pool of randomized questions can be generated by running this as a script.

```
using JuliaBlackBoard

dirnm = dirname(@__FILE__)
basenm = replace(basename(@__FILE__), r".jl$" => "") # grab names

open(joinpath(dirnm, "$basenm.txt"), "w") do io

  q = mt"""
# Times tables

What is {{:a}} * {{:b}}?
"""
  for a in 2:3, b in 2:3
    question(io, NUM, q(a=a,b=b), a*b)
  end
end
```	

If saved in `/tmp/test.jl`, say, and included into `Julia` with `include("/tmp/test.jl")`, a file `/tmp/test.txt` will be generated for upload into BlackBoard.

A kitchen-sink-type example is the  [examples](examples/test-examples.jl) directory.
